# ArrowSpace
Password Creation Playground - ArrowSpace Methodology

I've been playing around with a new password creation scheme that I'd like to share with those of you so inclined.

I'm calling it “ArrowSpace” for no other reason than that is basically what it involves.

Let's say your passphrase is the easy to recall (good) and easy to guess & crack (bad) Don't Call Me Shirley

Now because it's a passphrase, there are no spaces or punctuation, giving you DontCallMeShirley still very easy to crack and guess.

Now let's say you're a tricky one and have decided to use character substitution making your password more robust giving you D0ntC4llM3%h1rl3y more robust to be sure, but just a matter or minutes for a computer to do it's programmed magic to reveal your cleverness.

ArrowSpace takes this one step, or rather one arrowspace or more, in reverse. We've removed the spaces that would normally be inserted between words and what ArrowSpace suggests is to replace that space with the left arrow key (one or more or incremental times).

Here I'll type out the passphrase above as it'll appear upon each insertion of the following word, replacing the natural spaces with 2 left arrowspaces, stay with me here:

D0nt = Dont
D0C4llnt = Dont + 2 left arrows + Call
D0C4M3llnt = Dont + 2 left arrows + Call + 2 left arrows + Me
D0C4%hirl3yM3llnt = Dont + 2 left arrows + Call + 2 left arrows + Me + 2 left arrows + Shirley
As stated above, you can alter the number of arrowspaces, use incremental arrowspaces (1st word 1 arrowspace, 2nd word 2 arrowspaces...) etc., the idea here is that you have a password that is easy for you to recall, and more difficult for a hacker's script to guess using its dictionary lookups.

Will this solve the world's password problems? No. Might it help? Perhaps. Is the author using it? Someplaces :)

I'll leave you with the following: Use unique passwords for the locations you visit, wether they be websites, computer logins etc. If you have the opportunity, use two factor authentication, SSH keys or a combination. When you change the clocks (spring forward, fall back) and after you've changed the batteries in your smoke detectors, go ahead and change your various site passwords. It's an unfortunate fact that a good password won't protect you from all the evil in this world, but it can be a real barrier to a lot of it.
